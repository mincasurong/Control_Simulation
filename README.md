# Control System Simulation

This repository contains MATLAB code for simulating basic control systems. The simulations demonstrate fundamental control principles through practical examples.

## Contents

- **[Pendulum_Simple.m](Pendulum_Simple.m)**: MATLAB script for simulating a simple pendulum system.
- **[Simulation.m](Simulation.m)**: MATLAB script for running general control system simulations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB (for running the `.m` files)

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mincasurong/Control_Simulation.git
    cd Control_Simulation
    ```

2. Open the desired `.m` file in MATLAB and run it to execute the control system simulation.

### Example

To run the simple pendulum simulation:
1. Open `Pendulum_Simple.m` in MATLAB.
2. Run the script to visualize the pendulum motion.

To run a general control system simulation:
1. Open `Simulation.m` in MATLAB.
2. Run the script to see the control system in action.

## Control System Simulation

Control system simulations are essential for understanding the behavior and dynamics of systems under various control strategies. These scripts provide a hands-on approach to learning and visualizing control concepts.

### Key Features

- **Simple Pendulum Simulation**: Demonstrates basic principles of pendulum dynamics and control.
- **General Control System Simulation**: Provides a framework for simulating various control systems.
